# React - State management

[React.js](https://react.dev/) - official docs.
In React development, keeping track of how your application data changes over time is called state management.

1. ### Middlewares:

   <p>‍Middleware generally refers to software services that "glue together" separate features in existing software. For Redux, middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and handing the action off to the reducer: [ Action ] <-> [ Middleware ] <-> [ Dispatcher ]</p>

2. ### Flux:

   <p>‍Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. The major idea behind Flux is that there is a single-source of truth (the stores) and they can only be updated by triggering actions.</p>

3. ### Redux:

   <p>‍Redux is the state management library. It provides a JavaScript object called the store, which, once set up, includes all states in your application and updates them when necessary.</p>

5. ### Rxjs:

   <p>‍RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming (reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change) using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.</p>
