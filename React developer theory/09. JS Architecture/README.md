# JS Architecture

Frontend architecture is a collection of tools and processes that aims to improve the quality of frontend code while creating a more efficient and sustainable workflow.

1. ### Micro-frontend:

   <p>Micro-frontends is an architectural style for building web-based applications. Micro-frontends are taking the concept of micro-services to the frontend.</p>

2. ### Serverless:

   <p>‍‍Serverless architecture (also known as serverless computing or function as a service, FaaS) is a software design pattern where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer. Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.</p>

3. ### Single Page applications:

   <p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.</p>

4. ### Multi Page application:

   <p>‍A multi-page application (or an MPA) is a web application that consists of multiple web pages that are downloaded when a user visits different parts of the page.</p>
