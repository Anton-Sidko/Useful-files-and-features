# Dev tools

Development Tools help to accelerate the web development process. There are many front-end web development software that help you faster your development work.

1. ### Build Tools (Builder, Task Runners):

   <p>‍Build tools can save you valuable time. They can do a lot of useful stuff: download libraries, run tests, bundle packages, automatize tasks, and so much more.</p>

2. ### Task Runners (npmscripts, Gulp):

   <p>‍Task runners allows to automate many tasks (repetitive tasks: making a change, compressing the js and css file, minimize code to gain performance.). Gulp is a cross-platform, streaming task runner that lets developers automate many development tasks. NPM is the default ‘Node Package Manager’ for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.</p>

3. ### Modules Bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, Parcel):

   <p>Module bundlers are tools that process your modern JavaScript applications, internally build dependency graphs which map every modules your projects need and generate one or module bundles.</p>

   - [Rollup Documentation](https://rollupjs.org/)

4. ### Linters and Formatters (Prettier, ESLint):

   <p>‍Code formatters and code linters used to have the same code format everywhere (like "tabs" and "spaces") and use the best code practices for good quality (like "let"/"const" rather than "var").</p>

5. ### Package Manager (npm, yarn):

   <p>‍Package managers are tools that automatically handle the dependencies of a project.</p>

6. ### Cloud Deployment Platforms:

   <p>‍‍There are several cloud providers that offer the necessary services to build and deploy an application. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Heroku etc.</p>

7. ### CI/CD:

   <p>‍‍‍Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline. Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.</p>

8. ### VCS (Version control system):

   <p>‍‍‍‍Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Git (Git branching models), GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Mercurial, SVN.</p>
