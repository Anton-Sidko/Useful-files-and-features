# JS core

JavaScript is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.

1. ### ES6+:

   <p>ECMA means European Computer Manufacturer's Association. ECMAScript is a programming language standard that web browsers follow while interpreting Javascript.</p>

2. ### Asynchronous JS:

   <p>Using asynchronous JavaScript (such as callbacks, promises, and async/await), you can perform long network requests without blocking the main thread.</p>

4. ### Function context:

   <p>‚ÄçFunctions in JavaScript run in a specific context, and using the "this" variable we have access to it. All standard functions in the browser run under the Window context. Functions defined under an object or a class (another function) will use the context of the object it was created in. However, we can also change the context of a function at runtime, either before or while executing the function.</p>
