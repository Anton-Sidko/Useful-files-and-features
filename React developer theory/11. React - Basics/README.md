# React - Basics

[React.js](https://react.dev/) is a JS library. Unlike Angular, React.js makes it a developer's responsibility to set a project structure, find relevant services for HTTP routing, and so on. At this point, React's ideology is to be agile and provide developers with absolute freedom. As a result, it leads to minimizing the project's size from start, as they could involve those libraries that they need by a certain time.

1. ### Main principles:

   <p>‍‍React.js couldn't work alone, as it is only the View (V) and needs an engine for data processing.</p>

2. ### Class components/functional components:

   <p>‍React code is made of entities called components. Components can be rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, one can pass in values that are known as "props": Functional components are declared with a function that then returns some JSX. Class-based components are declared using ES6 classes.</p>

3. ### Component lifecycle:

   <p>‍Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.</p>

4. ### Context API:

   <p>‍‍The Context API is a component structure provided by the React, Context provides a way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.</p>

5. ### Props/state, setState:

   <p>Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.</p>

6. ### Hooks:

   <p>‍Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes. Hooks are backward-compatible, which means it does not contain any breaking changes. Also, it does not replace your knowledge of React concepts.</p>
