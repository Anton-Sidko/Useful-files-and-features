# Database

A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

1. ### Relational Databases, SQL, Joins:

   <p>‍A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.</p>

   <p>‍A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational")[1] database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.</p>

5. ### CAP theorem:

   <p>‍CAP theorem is also called brewer's theorem. It states that is impossible for a distributed data store to offer more than two out of three guarantees (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)</p>

6. ### ORM, Database Migrations:

   <p>‍Object–relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. Data migration is the process of selecting, preparing, extracting, and transforming data and permanently transferring it from one computer storage system to another.</p>
