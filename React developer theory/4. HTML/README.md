# HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

1. ### ES6+:

   <p>ECMA means European Computer Manufacturer's Association. ECMAScript is a programming language standard that web browsers follow while interpreting Javascript.</p>

2. ### Asynchronous JS:

   <p>Using asynchronous JavaScript (such as callbacks, promises, and async/await), you can perform long network requests without blocking the main thread.</p>

4. ### Function context:

   <p>‍Functions in JavaScript run in a specific context, and using the "this" variable we have access to it. All standard functions in the browser run under the Window context. Functions defined under an object or a class (another function) will use the context of the object it was created in. However, we can also change the context of a function at runtime, either before or while executing the function.</p>

5. ### Scope, Closures:

   <p>A scope in JavaScript defines what variables you have access to. There are two kinds of scope – global scope and local scope. Whenever you create a function within another function, you have created a closure. The inner function is the closure. This closure is usually returned so you can use the outer function’s variables at a later time.</p>
