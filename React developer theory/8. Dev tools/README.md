# Dev tools

Development Tools help to accelerate the web development process. There are many front-end web development software that help you faster your development work.

1. ### Build Tools (Builder, Task Runners):

   <p>‍Build tools can save you valuable time. They can do a lot of useful stuff: download libraries, run tests, bundle packages, automatize tasks, and so much more.</p>

2. ### Task Runners (npmscripts, Gulp):

   <p>‍Task runners allows to automate many tasks (repetitive tasks: making a change, compressing the js and css file, minimize code to gain performance.). Gulp is a cross-platform, streaming task runner that lets developers automate many development tasks. NPM is the default ‘Node Package Manager’ for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.</p>

7. ### CI/CD:

   <p>‍‍‍Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline. Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually.</p>

8. ### VCS (Version control system):

   <p>‍‍‍‍Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
