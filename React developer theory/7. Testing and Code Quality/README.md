# Testing and Code Quality

In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions: Software functional quality; Software structural quality.

1. ### Smoke Testing approaches and End to end tests:

   <p>‍Smoke Testing is a software testing process that determines whether the deployed software build is stable or not. End-to-end testing is a technique that tests the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application flow behaves as expected. The most popular examples: Smoke, Unit test, Black Box, Code Coverage, Selenium, Pupeteer.</p>

2. ### Test Frameworks:

   <p>‍The JavaScript testing framework is a dynamic framework based on JS. For example there are few of them, the most popular:</p>
