# Testing and Code Quality

In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions: Software functional quality; Software structural quality.

1. ### SmokeTesting approaches and End to end tests:

End-to-end testing is a technique that tests the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application flow behaves as expected. The most popular examples: Smoke, Unit test, Black Box, Code Coverage, Selenium, Pupeteer.</p>
