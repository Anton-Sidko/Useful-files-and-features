# React - Rendering

In [React.js](https://react.dev/), the render() method is the only required method in a class component, and is responsible for describing the view to be rendered to the browser window.

1. ### JSX:

   <p>‍‍JSX, or JavaScript XML, is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.</p>

2. ### Conditional rendering:

   <p>In React, we can create multiple components which encapsulate behavior that we need. After that, we can render them depending on some conditions or the state of our application. In other words, based on one or several conditions, a component decides which elements it will return. In React, conditional rendering works the same way as the conditions work in JavaScript. We use JavaScript operators to create elements representing the current state, and then React Component update the UI to match them.</p>

3. ### Preventing rendering:

   <p>‍‍Sometimes it might happen that a component hides itself even though another component rendered it. To do this (prevent a component from rendering), we will have to return null instead of its render output.</p>
